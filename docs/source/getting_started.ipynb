    "- **Client sandbox**: A directory created within the working directory from where the RP application was launched. The sandbox is named after the session ID, e.g., `rp.session.nodename.username.018952.0000`.\n",
    "- **Agent sandbox**: A directory created at a different location, depending on the machine on which the application executes. The Agent sandbox, named `radical.pilot.sandbox`, contains the following nested directories: `<session_sandbox_ID>/<pilot_sandbox_ID>/<task_sandbox_ID>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running RADICAL-Pilot locally, the Agent sandbox is located at `$HOME/radical.pilot.sandbox`. When using a [supported HPC platform](supported.rst), the location of the Agent sandbox depends on the filesystem capabilities of the platform.
