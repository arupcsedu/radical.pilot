    "In the examples we have, so far, been running single-core tasks.  By expanding the task description to include the `ranks` attribute, we can request multiple MPI ranks to be created where each rank uses one core.  Additional resource requirements can be specified per rank:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `cores_per_rank`: the number of cores each rank can user for spawning additional threads or processes\n",
    "  - `gpus_per_rank`: the number of GPUs each rank can utilize\n",
    "  - `mem_per_rank`: the size of memory (in Megabytes) which is available to each rank\n",
    "  - `lfs_per_rank`: the amount of node-local file storage which is available to each rank\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `radical-pilot-hello.sh` command to report on rank creation:"
