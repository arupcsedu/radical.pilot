# Prerequisite for jupter notebook

The Kernel is usually setup automatically when we install and run jupyter but if in case it is not see steps below.

```shell
jupyter kernelspec list #check available kernel

ipython kernel install --name "python3" --user #install a kernel

#change the display name to "Python 3 (ipykernel)" in kernel.json as this the default name generated by jupyter. 
# This is to keep the metadata of notebook in sync, and avoid unnecessary diff. 
```

# Setting up the docs environment

## Install dependencies for building documentation 
```shell
pip install -r docs/source/requirements_docs.txt
```
## How to pass environment variables
`.env` file #TODO this is being discussed and is not final.

So users have to create/edit the .env file which is ideally placed in project root directory.
See usage of dot-env [here](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).
```shell
dotenv set RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL mongodb://localhost:27017/rpdb
# This will create a file in {PROJECT_ROOT} and add a variable RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL
# Replace the mongo URL as necessary. Format -  mongodb://<user_id>:<password>@<ip_address>:<port>/<db_name> 
```
