    "# Debugging a RADICAL-Pilot Application\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot is a complex runtime system which employes multiple distributed components to orchestrate workload execution.  It is also a *research software*,  funded by research grants.  As such it is possibly it is not quite comparable to commercially supported software systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, RADICAL-Pilot targets mostly academic HPC environments and high end machines which are usually at the cutting edge of hard and software development.  Those machines thus usually have their own custom and sometimes peculiar and evolving system environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that is to say that it might be necessary to investigate various possible failure modes, both failures related to the execution of your workload tasks, and also possibly failures related to RADICAL-Pilot's own operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook attempts to guide you through different means to investigate possible failure modes.  That is not necessarily an intuitive process, but hopefully serves to cover the most common problems.  We want to encourage you to seek support from the RCT develope community via TODO if the presented means proof insufficient."
