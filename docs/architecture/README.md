### RP architecture snippets

The documentations, discussions and code snippets contained in this directory
are likely not useful to any RP user.  They mostly represent design studies and
prototype implementations of certain aspects of the RP architecture.  That
information is kept here for historic reasons - more up to date and digestible
infrmation on these topics are now located on the project's [github
discussions](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/discussions).
